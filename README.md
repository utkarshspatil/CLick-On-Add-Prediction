# CLick-On-Add-Prediction
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
For this you will be requiring to install all libraries first.
I have done it using pip.
First download pip.
THEN you just have to install all libraries via pip install Library_Name.
Libraries used here are 
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
